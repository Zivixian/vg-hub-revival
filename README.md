no this isnt a full on fleshed out vg hub revival its kinda just something i felt like doing because it just doesnt exist (its missing like half of what makes it neat but it works)

im not adding more games unless i feel like it cause im not even sure how much of vg hub is out there to complete restoration

also if you ever find this and decide to use it; it SHOULD(?) work on most free shitty script tools for roblox

i take no credit since i didnt do any of the hard work i just put it together

the only working game for it right now is sbs: loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zivixian/vg-hub-revival/main/gmaes/SuperBombSurvival.lua"))()
